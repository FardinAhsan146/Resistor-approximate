This project's goal was to find the smallest list of resistors from a bigger list that add up to a target series/parallel combination within a specified tolerance range. 
The project was improved by Michael Jurasovic (https://jurasofish.github.io) by making use of an mip model to improve performace (https://jurasofish.github.io/picking-resistors-for-parallel-and-series-equivalence.html). 

I have permission from him to use his code to turn the project into a website, that might help students in circuit labs, helping them not waste time finding the right combination of resistors/capacitors to match hand calculated values.
